# École polytechnique | INF442 - Big Data with C++

Academic year: 2017-2018

Teaching coordinators: [Franck Nielsen](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~nielsen/) and [Claudia D'Ambrosio](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Claudia.D'Ambrosio/)

This gentle introduction to **High Performance Computing** (HPC) for **Data Science** using the **Message Passing Interface** (MPI) is a first course for undergraduates on **parallel programming** on distributed memory models, and requires only basic programming notions (INF321  or INF411).

Divided into two parts the first part covers **high performance computing** using **C++** with the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard followed by a second part **providing high-performance data analytics** on computer **clusters**.

In the first part, the fundamental notions of **blocking** versus **non-blocking** point-to-point communications, global communications (like **broadcast** or **scatter**) and collaborative computations (reduce), with **Amdalh** and **Gustafson** speed-up laws are described before addressing parallel sorting and parallel linear algebra on computer clusters. The common ring, torus and hypercube **topologies of clusters** are then explained and global communication procedures on these topologies are studied. This first part closes with the **MapReduce** (MR) model of computation well-suited to processing **big data** using the MPI framework.

In the second part, the course focuses on high-performance data analytics. Flat and hierarchical **clustering algorithms** are introduced for data exploration along with how to program these algorithms on computer clusters, followed by **machine learning** classification, and an introduction to **graph analytics**. This part closes with a concise introduction to data core-sets that let big data problems be amenable to tiny data problems.
